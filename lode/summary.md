# ProgenitorNodeModelCosmology Summary

N-body cosmology simulator testing whether External-Node Model (classical tidal forces from trans-observable massive structures) can replicate ΛCDM expansion without dark energy. Python codebase uses Leapfrog integration to evolve 300 particles under internal gravity + tidal forces from 26 HMEA (Hyper-Massive External Attractor) nodes in 3×3×3-1 cubic lattice. Draft paper (docs/paper.tex) proposes Progenitor Hypothesis: Big Bang was destabilization of a node in virialized meta-structure, explaining isotropy. Currently exploring parameter space around M≈800×M_observable, S≈24 Gpc which achieves 99.4% match to ΛCDM. Toy model scope: late-time acceleration only; doesn't address CMB, BAO, structure formation, or early universe. Code purpose: test mechanism viability, explore parameters, generate data for ongoing draft refinement. Key technical insights: (1) initial velocities use damping=1.0 (full Hubble flow) with COM removal and RMS radius normalization ensuring all models start with identical size, (2) Hubble drag NOT applied in proper coordinates (dark energy handles expansion), (3) leapfrog pre-kick eliminates "initial bump" artifact by properly initializing velocity staggering at t=-dt/2, (4) solve_friedmann_at_times computes ΛCDM baseline at exact N-body snapshot times for precise alignment, (5) timestep validation enforces dt_s < 0.05 Gyr to prevent leapfrog instability, (6) unit-aware variable naming (_m, _s, _kg, _si, _mps2 suffixes) throughout codebase for clarity.
