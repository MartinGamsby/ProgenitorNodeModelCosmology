# ProgenitorNodeModelCosmology Summary

N-body cosmology simulator testing whether External-Node Model (classical tidal forces from trans-observable massive structures) can replicate ΛCDM expansion without dark energy. Python codebase uses Leapfrog integration to evolve 300 particles under internal gravity + tidal forces from 26 HMEA (Hyper-Massive External Attractor) nodes in cubic lattice. Draft paper (docs/paper.tex) proposes Progenitor Hypothesis: Big Bang was destabilization of a node in virialized meta-structure, explaining isotropy. Currently exploring parameter space around M≈800×M_observable, S≈24 Gpc which achieves 99.4% match to ΛCDM. Toy model scope: late-time acceleration only; doesn't address CMB, BAO, structure formation, or early universe. Code purpose: test mechanism viability, explore parameters, generate data for ongoing draft refinement. Key technical insight: damped initial velocities (damping≈0.91) compensate for absence of ongoing Hubble drag in matter-dominated regime.
