# ProgenitorNodeModelCosmology Summary

N-body cosmology simulator testing whether External-Node Model (classical tidal forces from trans-observable massive structures) can replicate ΛCDM expansion without dark energy. Python codebase uses Leapfrog integration to evolve 200-300 particles under internal gravity + tidal forces from 26 HMEA (Hyper-Massive External Attractor) nodes in 3×3×3-1 cubic lattice. Draft paper (docs/paper.tex) proposes Progenitor Hypothesis: Big Bang was destabilization of a node in virialized meta-structure, explaining isotropy. Parameter exploration (via parameter_sweep.py) finds MULTIPLE close matches (M=855 S=25, M=97000 S=65, M=69 S=15) achieving >99% endpoint match with R²>0.89 for expansion rate dynamics. Matter-only comparison validates mechanism: matter-only reaches ~96% endpoint but R²_expansion=-0.48 (catastrophic), proving external-nodes provide genuine acceleration, not coincidental endpoint. Toy model scope: late-time acceleration (t=3.8→13.8 Gyr, 10 Gyr period); doesn't address CMB, BAO, structure formation, or early universe. Starts at t=3.8 Gyr (not Big Bang) to focus on late-universe expansion. Code purpose: test mechanism viability, explore parameters, generate data for ongoing draft refinement. Key technical insights: (1) initial velocities use damping=0.98 (nearly full Hubble flow) with COM removal and RMS radius normalization ensuring all models start with identical size, (2) Hubble drag NOT applied in proper coordinates (dark energy handles expansion), (3) leapfrog pre-kick eliminates "initial bump" artifact by properly initializing velocity staggering at t=-dt/2, (4) solve_friedmann_at_times computes ΛCDM baseline at exact N-body snapshot times for precise alignment, (5) timestep validation enforces dt_s < 0.05 Gyr to prevent leapfrog instability, (6) unit-aware variable naming (_m, _s, _kg, _si, _mps2 suffixes) throughout codebase for clarity, (7) Auto force calculation: uses Numba JIT-compiled O(N²) for N≥100 (14-17x speedup, exact results), NumPy vectorized O(N²) for N<100 (simpler). Despite name "barnes_hut", speedup from compilation not tree approximation. (8) R² metric (coefficient of determination) provides statistical rigor; last-half R² (5 Gyr) isolates late-time acceleration behavior. (9) Validation: 158 tests including matter-only comparison (R²_expansion=-0.48 catastrophic failure proves external-nodes provide genuine acceleration mechanism), Numba tidal force verification, reproducibility checks, COM drift quality tests.
